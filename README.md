# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import the math function 
### Step 2:
Make two list which consist of two variables and initialize them
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
We do this buy using the sqrt function 
### Step 5: 
Print the value
### PROGRAM:
#Program to find the distance between two points.

```
import math 
x1, y1 = 4, 2
x2, y2 = 10,6
distance = math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)
print(f"{distance:.2f}")
```


### OUTPUT:

### RESULT:
Thus the distance between two points is found
